# Reflective Blog 3

## Prompt E: 

Analyze a chatbot (e.g., customer service, virtual assistant). Spend at least 5 minutes interacting with it & exploring its functionality. Then, reflect on the bot's: purpose (What is the chatbot designed to do?, functionality (how well does it perform its tasks?), user experience (was it easy to use? What were the strengths and weaknesses?), and context (how does it benefit users and the organization?)

After spending plenty of time with Shein AI customer service, I have drafted a reflective analysis on its functionality and user experience.

Purpose: The Shein AI chatbot, named Siyo, is designed to assist users with common customer service questions, such as tracking orders, processing returns and refunds, and answering questions related to order processing. It's created to provide automated responses to frequently asked questions, helping users navigate Shein's support system without the need of human. 

Functionality: The chatbot start with list of options through topics like "Order processing time", "No tracking updated", "Order delayed" and "Return items". ALthough it very helpful to the users, the AI struggles to answer direct questions outside its structured responses or answer very general with some of specific questions. For example, when users ask about order status, it often suggests checking account credentials or contacting customer service instead of retrieving specific details.

User Experience: The chatbot interface is straightforward and easy to navigate, with clear button options to select relevant questions. Its strength include promt responses and approach to common issues. However, the weakness happen when users ask more specific or complex questions, leading to frustration when it cannot provide direct answers. Additionally, user may find the repeated prompting to select categories, limiting the chatbot's ability to engage in a more natural conversation.

Context: or Shein, the chatbot helps manage a large number of customer questions efficiently. It reduces the need for human agents, allowing them to handle more complex issues. For users, it provides quick answers to common questions but struggles with personalized requests. Improving real-time order tracking and making conversations more natural could enhance customer satisfaction and streamline support.

Conclusion: Overall, the Shein AI chatbot serves its intended purpose of guiding customers through common inquiries, but its limitations in handling complex or personalized questions reduce its effectiveness. This limitation can improve in the future for the usser expreience.
