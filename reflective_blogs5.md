# Reflective Blog 5

## Prompt K:

Use any generative AI to generate an assignment (or some other piece of writing) that you have already completed. Share the prompt you used, the results you received, and a brief analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the software.

After review the Manual Assessment Memo, I have drafted a reflective analysis on the AI generation of its strengths and weaknesses. 
<br>


**Structure and Format**: The chatGPT AI uses a standard memo hearder followed by each different sections such as: overview, strengths, areas for improvement, and recommendation. The AI memo structured with numbered lists and bullets points throughout. It presents with three strength categories and three improvement areas, with two bullet points of elavoration.

**Strenghts**: The AI produced a well-structured, visually organized memo with appropriate headings, numbering, and bullet points. It created a balanced assessment framework with strengths, areas for improvement, and specific recommendations that follow logically from the identified issues. There's a logical progression from identifying issues to providing corresponding recommendations that address each problem area. The AI demonstrated its knowledge by mentioning revlevant technical terms like "BIOS settings, UEFI Firmware, CTR 21 Compliance" and "ASUS utilities".

**Weaknesses**: The AI mannual memo assesment lack of showing deep engagement with the specific Zenbook Flip 15 manual. It also lack of personalization with left placeholdres like "[Your Name]" and "[Insert Date]". Compare to my memo, the AI didn't include the source of the specific context about how the evaluation was conducted. The tone writing is stilted and corporate compare to mine memo. Finally, the AI memo has formulaic structure where each strength or weakness follows the same pattern, making it feel less natural.

**Conclusion**: The structure of chatGPT sound business documents with appropriate formatting and organization. However, it lacks the personal touch, specific insights, and context compare to human-written memo provides. The primary advantage of AI seems to be quickly generate a comprehensive framework, while its main limitation is providing the specific, contextually relevant insights that come from actually engaging deeply with the material.
