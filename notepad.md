# NotePad (Critical adivise) 
## Website Setup: 
"Looks good! You might want to also delete the link to the instructional page for copying the website. I see an icon for an image but I don't see that image itself - let me know if you need some more help. :)

I like your AI statement - it doesn't just state what you used for transparency but also shows off that you understand a bit more about the tool. For the about me paragraph itself, there are some wording issues that your AI didn't catch, so here is how I would suggest revising it (my suggested changes are in bold-I did delete the "This is" at the beginning and the quote at the end):

Thai (he/him), is a motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science student, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science aspiring to become a software engineer. With a solid understanding of programming principles and a strong desire to learn and grow, he excels in problem solving and analytical thinking, ready in developing technical skills and contributing to the success of a team. Through his academic journey, Thai has worked in various positions, beginning in the fast-paced retail industry, to an Volunteer Researcher where he collaborated with many experts, and right now he serves as a Game Technology Specialist Assistant on multiple gaming projects. Each role has developed both professional and personal growth."
