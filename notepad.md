# NotePad (Critical adivise) 
## Website Setup: 
"Looks good! You might want to also delete the link to the instructional page for copying the website. I see an icon for an image but I don't see that image itself - let me know if you need some more help. :)

I like your AI statement - it doesn't just state what you used for transparency but also shows off that you understand a bit more about the tool. For the about me paragraph itself, there are some wording issues that your AI didn't catch, so here is how I would suggest revising it (my suggested changes are in bold-I did delete the "This is" at the beginning and the quote at the end):

Thai (he/him), is a motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science student, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science aspiring to become a software engineer. With a solid understanding of programming principles and a strong desire to learn and grow, he excels in problem solving and analytical thinking, ready in developing technical skills and contributing to the success of a team. Through his academic journey, Thai has worked in various positions, beginning in the fast-paced retail industry, to an Volunteer Researcher where he collaborated with many experts, and right now he serves as a Game Technology Specialist Assistant on multiple gaming projects. Each role has developed both professional and personal growth."

"This is a nice summary of your analysis. It would be helpful to show some example images or links from these sites, or to focus on one specific site and compare its appearance today to its appearance many years ago. 

(I also noticed that you updated the image on your "about me" page! Looks great!)"

Nice job with the Markdown formatting! 

Make sure you send the direct link to the page each time - I looked on the Reflective Blogs link first and didn't find it there.

I like the table of contents here, but unless they are linked, it's not necessary to have that for a short quick-start guide.

Fishing is a bit complex for a quick-start guide topic. For a quick-start, it is best to only focus on the actions the readers need to follow, not the definitions of words or rationale behind them--the "what" not the "why." So this section defining things doesn't belong in a guide like this. The quick-start should be specific steps for a specific topic: how to bait a hook with a worm; how to spool a fishing reel; etc.

There are a lot of specialized terms here that a novice may not know: bobber, combo set, the different types of line, bale arm, etc. Try to use words that the novice would understand or briefly explain them in the sentence: 

Nice job including images here! But there should always be text between images. Adding one image under each step would be helpful. Make sure to add captions: Figure 1. Short description (Image by: [linked name]). Without citations, you could be violating copyright. If they are photos you have taken yourself, cite yourself so that it is clear you took them. 

Technical writing doesn't typically include introductions or conclusions. Just one final step that indicates the process is complete. 

As always, let me know if you have questions or I can clarify any of my feedback!
