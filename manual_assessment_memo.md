# Manual Assessment Memo

**MEMORANDUM**
**To**: Samson Hu CEO of ASUS
**From**: Thai Nguyen
**Subject**: Recommendations for ZenBook Flip 15 manual
**Date**: February 9, 2025

I evaluated the manual for ZenBook Flip 15 available at: https://www.manua.ls/asus/zenbook-flip-15/manual


**Strength**
The strength of this manual are extremely significant comprehensive. It probides a well-structured overview of the notebook's hardware, including a detailed description of ports, buttons, and features. The step-by-step setup instructions are clear and brief, allow users to easily get started. Additionally, the manual offers useful troobleshooting tips and FAQs, which can be helpful for resolving common issues.


**Weakness**
Despite the strengths, there are notable weaknessses that need to be addressed. The BIOS access instructions could be easy-understanding from adding explanations for users unfamiliar with technical terminology. As well, the manual lacks visual aids for certain hardware components, which could improve comprehension. Finally, the troubleshooting could add more in the potential issues section, such as Wi-Fi connectivity problems or battery calibration. 


To improve the manual, I recommend the following modifications:
- Simplify technical explanations for BIOS setting.
- Include more illustrations and diagrams of hardware components.
- Expand the troubleshooting section for more common issues.
- Add a section for optimizing battery performance and longevity.
