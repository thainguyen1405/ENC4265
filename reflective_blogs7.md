# Reflective Blog 7

## Prompt Q:

Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 



**Reflection:** After using the AI tool to analyze my resume, I was impressed by the effectively of it on how the tool identified my strenghts and areas for improvement. Instead of generating general suggestions, the AI provided detail recimmendations aligned with my target fields, including AI/ML, software engineering, and full-stack development. One specific thing was how the AI transformed my broad project descriptions into measureable achievements, such as highlighting "85% prediction accuracy" in my football analytics platform. By that, the AI helped me refocus my experiences to better align with employer expectations.

**Suggestion:** To make my resume truly stand out, the AI recommended emphasizing "magnetism" which naturally capture an employer's attention. The suggestion included"

- Leading with technical projects rather than education to highlight hands-on skills
- Incorporating industry-specific keywords like "scikit-learn" and "Agile development" for better compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Repurposing non-technical work experience, such as my retail job, to emphasize transferable skills like problem-solving
- Creating tailored versions of my resume to align with different career paths

**What did I learn?** 

Specificity is key: Numbers and technical details (e.g., "Flask API" vs. "web app") make accomplishments more credible.

Everything is relevant: Even my hospital volunteer work demonstrated valuable skills like troubleshooting techâ€”I just needed to reframe it.

One-size-fits-none: A generalized resume works against me; tailoring content for each job application is worth the effort.

AI is a starting point: While the tool caught structural issues, human judgment is still needed for nuance (like emphasizing open-source contributions).
