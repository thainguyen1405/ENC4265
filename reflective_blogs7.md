# Reflective Blog 7

## Prompt Q:

Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn?

**Reflection:** After using the AI tool to analyze my resume, I was impressed by the effectively of it on how the tool identified my strenghts and areas for improvement. Instead of generating general suggestions, the AI provided detail recimmendations aligned with my target fields, including AI/ML, software engineering, and full-stack development. One specific thing was how the AI transformed my broad project descriptions into measureable achievements, such as highlighting prediction accuracy in my football analytics platform. By that, the AI helped me refocus my experiences to better align with employer expectations.

**Suggestion:** To make my resume truly stand out, the AI recommended emphasizing "magnetism" which naturally capture an employer's attention. The suggestion included"

- Leading with technical projects rather than education to highlight hands-on skills
- Incorporating industry-specific keywords like "scikit-learn" and "Agile development" for better compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Repurposing non-technical work experience, such as my retail job, to emphasize transferable skills like problem-solving
- Creating tailored versions of my resume to align with different career paths

**What did I learn?** 

I learned that specificity is crucialâ€”numbers and technical details, such as "Flask API" versus just "web app," make accomplishments much more credible. I also realized that everything in my experience is relevant; even my hospital volunteer work showcased valuable skills like troubleshooting technology, but I just needed to reframe it. Another key insight was that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for resumes. Focusing content for each job application makes a significant difference. Finally, I discovered that while AI can be a helpful starting point, human judgment is still essential, especially when it comes to adding nuance, like emphasizing open-source contributions.
