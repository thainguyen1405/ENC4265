# Reflective Blog 7

## Prompt Q:

Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 



**Reflection:** After using the AI tool to analyze my resume, I was surprised by how effectively it identified my core strengths and weaknesses. The tool didn't just suggest generic improvements—it tailored recommendations specifically for my target fields (AI/ML, software engineering, and full-stack development). What stood out most was how it transformed vague project descriptions into quantifiable achievements, like specifying "85% prediction accuracy" for my football analytics platform. This exercise made me realize my resume was telling a story, but not the right one—until the AI helped reframe my experiences to speak directly to employer needs.

**Suggestion:** To make my resume truly stand out, the AI suggested focusing on "magnetism"—elements that naturally draw employer attention. This included:
Leading with technical projects rather than education to showcase hands-on skills

Adding industry keywords like "scikit-learn" and "Agile development" for ATS compatibility

Repurposing non-technical work experience (like my retail job) to highlight transferable skills like problem-solving

Creating role-specific versions of my resume to address different career paths

**What did I learn?** 

Specificity is key: Numbers and technical details (e.g., "Flask API" vs. "web app") make accomplishments more credible.

Everything is relevant: Even my hospital volunteer work demonstrated valuable skills like troubleshooting tech—I just needed to reframe it.

One-size-fits-none: A generalized resume works against me; tailoring content for each job application is worth the effort.

AI is a starting point: While the tool caught structural issues, human judgment is still needed for nuance (like emphasizing open-source contributions).
