# Website Setup
Dr Emily Johnson advises "Looks good! You might want to also delete the link to the instructional page for copying the website. I see an icon for an image but I don't see that image itself - let me know if you need some more help. :)"


## AI Reflection
After several test cases by using ChatGPT to create a quick start guide, I was surprised at how fast and straightforward it was. At first, I gave a briefly short prompt for the computer quick start set-up, chatGPT declared the point very well through each steps but a little lacked details. However, after I tried to prompt the idea again and again, I found that the AI's response improved significantly with clear and extreme details in each part of the setup. One strength, I noticed that the chatGPT's ability to produce well-structured lists and clear bullet points, which is really helpful as step by step, easily led me to the final guide. In contrast, for my specific prompt (setup computer), It was not very ideal for me by looking at the description rather than having the visual picture tutorial like video, and sometimes the AI tool occasionally repeated itself or included filler material. Finally, the experience with AI was amazing since I said I was surprised by how quickly it adapted to each prompt tweak, it would be more accurate for me to double-check AI-generated content for correctness, generally chatGPT is a phenomenal tool for precise instructions, able to approach for everyone.

# Reflective Blog 1 (Wayback Analysis)
My experience with outdated websites include news, entertainment, shopping, etc focusing on user experience and design elements that impact the users.

## Font Text
Websites use basic sysstem fonts like Times New Roman and Arial that were hard to read. The text was often squeezed together with little space between lines. Many sites had text colors that blended into the background, making it difficult to read the content.

## Navigation
Finding your way around old websites was often confusing. Menus were poorly organized, and users had to click through many pages to find what they needed. Many links stopped working when sites moved their content around, leaving users at dead ends.

## Layout
Old websites used rigid layouts that looked like tables, making the content feel stiff and boxy. Many sites split their pages into separate sections using frames, which made browsing feel clunky.

## Standard expect & Outdated experience
My perspective, modern websites should follow the minimalism to create clear, focused user experiences. Clean layouts using whitespace to let content hit and guide users' attention. Navigation menus are streamlined, could use simple icons. Color palettes consider choosing 2-3 main colors comfortable with users. Content is organized in a clear visual hierarchy, with consistent heading styles and card-based layouts that divide information into readable sections. The result would let users can quickly find what they need without feeling overwhelmed by unnecessary design elements.


My experience with outdated sites was lost and uncomfortable. The text was hard to read, and everything looked messy and cluttered. Sometimes I even got chills looking through them - they felt spooky in a way. The websites didn't show information clearly, I was very focus just to understand what I was looking at. The old-fashioned fonts and text layout made my eyes tired, and I found myself wanting to leave the sites quickly. It was strange to see how different these were from the clean, easy-to-use websites I'm used to today.
