Use NotebookLM (log in with your Google account or make a new Google account for experimenting with this) to analyze a manual from the web (manua.ls has a ton) (See their privacy policy here). Share a brief report describing your process, the manual, and your thoughts on the tool. What did it make easier for you? What was not easy? What do you think about the use of this AI for your future career?

**Reflection:** After using the NotebookLM to analyze the file I upload "Asus ZenBook Flip 15 User Manual (PDF, 106 pages)". I've asked the AI several questions, including:

- “Summarize the main features of the Asus ZenBook Flip 15”

- “How does this manual explain setting up and using the ZenBook Flip 15 for the first time?”

- “Explain the safety precautions and maintenance tips in the manual”

  |:--:|
  | *Screenshot by Thai Nguyen. The image highlights that NotebookLM found no safety or maintenance content in the manual excerpt.*|
  
- “How does this tool help me understand the document better compared to reading it myself?”

**Easy:** One thing I really liked was the design and layout of NotebookLM, it’s clean, modern, and easy to navigate. It helped me stay organized as I worked through the assignment, and the interface made it simple to ask and track questions. Even though it couldn't process the full manual, the tool itself was user-friendly and well-structured.

<br>

**Uneasy:** The main problem here was that NotebookLM didn’t seem to fully process the entire PDF. It mainly read just the cover and a few metadata lines, which meant it couldn’t provide meaningful answers to my content questions. I wasn’t able to get any information on setup instructions, features, or troubleshooting, which limited the usefulness of the tool in this case.

<br>

**Using NotebookLM for future:** Despite this limitation, I can still see the potential of NotebookLM in a professional setting. If it works with properly formatted documents, it could be a valuable tool for summarizing large files, organizing research, and saving time during document reviews. With improvements to how it handles file content, I would consider using it again in the future.
